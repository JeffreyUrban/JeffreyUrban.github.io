# `sar`  

Can collect and display data over longer periods.

Using `sar` utility you can do two things:
1. Monitor system real time performance (CPU, Memory, I/O, etc.)
1. Collect performance data in the background on an on-going basis and do analysis on the historical data to identify bottlenecks.  

# Nagios

## Install   

`yum install -y pcp, pcp-system-tools`  

## Take baseline of a metric \(kernel load\):  

`pmval kernel.all.load`  

for 10s: `-T 10s`  

## Find the logger file directory:  

`pcp | grep logger`  

## Show the logged kernel load \(replace with file spanning desired time\):  

`pmrep -t 1m -a /20190519.03.03.0 kernel.all.load`
